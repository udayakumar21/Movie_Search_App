1.Movie Information Retrieval: Developed a responsive Movie Info Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for information about movies. Utilized the TMDB API to fetch and display movie details, including titles, release dates, posters, and overviews. The application provides a seamless user experience by loading additional results as the user scrolls, offering a comprehensive database of movies.

2.Enhanced User Experience: Implemented a feature to enhance the user experience by allowing users to watch movie trailers. Incorporated JavaScript to dynamically retrieve and open the YouTube trailer link for each movie when the "See Trailer" button is clicked. This feature offers users a convenient way to preview movies of interest, making the application more engaging and interactive.

3.Technical Skills Demonstrated: Demonstrated proficiency in web development technologies, including API integration, asynchronous data fetching, event handling, and responsive design. The project showcases strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users. It serves as a testament to practical JavaScript programming and front-end development expertise.
